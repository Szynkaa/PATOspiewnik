\begin{piosenka}{Zombie -- The Cranberries}
Another head hangs lowly & e C \\*
Child is slowly taken & G D \\*
And the violence caused such silence & e C \\*
Who are we mistaken & G D \\[\zwrotkaspace]
 
But you see, it's not me & e \\*
It's not my family & C \\*
In your head, in your head & G \\*
They are fighting & D \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace With their tanks, and their bombs & e \\*
\refrenspace And their bombs, and their guns & C \\*
\refrenspace In your head, in your head & G \\*
\refrenspace They are cryin' & D \\*
\refrenspace In your head, in your head & e C \\*
\refrenspace Zombie, zombie, zombie & G D \\*
\refrenspace What's in your head in your head & e C \\*
\refrenspace Zombie, zombie, zombie & G D \\[\zwrotkaspace]
 
Another mother's breakin' & e C \\*
Heart is taking over & G D \\*
When the violence causes silence & e C \\*
We must be mistaken & G D \\[\zwrotkaspace]
 
It's the same old theme & e \\*
Since 1916 & C \\*
In your head, in your head & G \\*
They're still fightin' & D \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace With their tanks\ldots \\*
