{\footnotesize \begin{piosenka}[3mm]{Hotel California -- The Eagles}
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair & h Fis \\
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air & A E \\
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light & G D \\
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim & e \\
I had to stop for the night. & Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell & h Fis \\
And I was thinking to myself ,,This could be heaven or this could be hell'' & A E \\ 
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way & G D \\
There were voices down the corridor, & e \\
I thought I heard them say & Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace Welcome to the Hotel California & G D \\
\refrenspace Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face. & e h$^7$ \\ 
\refrenspace Plenty of room at the Hotel California & G D \\ 
\refrenspace Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here & e Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes benz & h Fis \\
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends & A E \\
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat & G D \\
Some dance to remember,& e \\
some dance to forget & Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

So I called up the Captain, ,,Please bring me my wine'' & h Fis \\
He said, ,,we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'' & A E \\
And still those voices are calling from far away, & G D \\
Wake you up in the middle of the night & e \\
Just to hear them say & Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace Welcome to the Hotel California & G D \\
\refrenspace Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face. & e h$^7$ \\  
\refrenspace They livin' it up at the Hotel California  & G D \\ 
\refrenspace What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis  & e Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice & h Fis \\
And she said, ,,we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'' & A E \\
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast & G D \\
They stab it with their steely knives, & e \\
But they just can't kill the beast & Fis \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Last thing I remember, I was running for the door & h Fis \\
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before & A E \\
,,Relax'' said the night man, ,,We are programmed to receive. & G D \\
You can check out any time you like, & e \\
But you can never leave!'' & Fis
