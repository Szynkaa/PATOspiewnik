And one more question for you; & G G \\[\zwrotkaspace]

,,Got any grapes?'' (Bum bum bum) & C C F G \\*
(bum bum bum) \\[\zwrotkaspace]

And the man just stopped. Then he started to smile. \\*
He started to laugh. He laughed for a while. \\*
He said: ,,Come on duck, let’s walk to the store. \\*
I’ll buy you some grapes \\*
So you won’t have to ask anymore.'' \\[\zwrotkaspace]

So they walked to the store and the man bought some grapes. \\*
He gave one to the duck and the duck said: \\*
,,Hmmm\ldots No thanks. \\*
But you know what sounds good? \\*
It would make my day. \\*
Do you think this store \\*
Do you think this store \\*
Do you think this store \\*

\refrenspace Then he waddled away. (Waddle waddle) \\*
