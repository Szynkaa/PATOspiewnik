\begin{piosenka}{The night we met -- Lord Huron}

I am not the only travele & a G C \\
Who has not repaid his debt & a C F \\
I've been searching for a trail to follow again & a G C \\
Take me back to the night we met & a C F \\[\zwrotkaspace]
	
And then I can tell myself & a G C \\
What the hell I'm supposed to do & a C F \\
And then I can tell myself & a G C \\
Not to ride along with you & a C F \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace I had all and then most of you & a \\
\refrenspace Some and now none of you & G C \\
\refrenspace Take me back to the night we met & a C F \\
\refrenspace I don't know what I'm supposed to do & a \\
\refrenspace Haunted by the ghost of you & G C \\
\refrenspace Oh, take me back to the night we met & a C F \\[\zwrotkaspace]

When the night was full of terrors & a G C \\
And your eyes were filled with tears & a C F \\
When you had not touched me yet & a G C \\
Oh, take me back to the night we met & a C F \\[\zwrotkaspace]
