{\small \begin{piosenka}[2mm]{Always Look on the Bright Side of Life -- Eric Idle}
Some things in life are bad & d G \\*
They can really make you mad & C a \\*
Other things just make you swear and curse & d G C \\*
When you're chewing on life's gristle & d G \\*
Don't grumble, give a whistle & C a \\*
And this'll help things turn out for the best & d G$^7$ \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace And always look on the bright side of life & C a d G$^7$ C a d G$^7$ \\*
\refrenspace Always look on the light side of life & C a d G$^7$ C a d G$^7$ \\[\zwrotkaspace]

If life seems jolly rotten & d G \\*
There's something you've forgotten & C a \\*
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing & d G C \\*
When you're feeling in the dumps & d G \\*
Don't be silly chumps & C a \\*
Just purse your lips and whistle -- that's the thing & d G$^7$ \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace And always look\ldots \\[\zwrotkaspace]

For life is quite absurd & d G \\*
And death's the final word & C a \\*
You must always face the curtain with a bow & d G C \\*
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin & d G \\*
Enjoy it -- it's your last chance anyhow & C a \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace So always look on the bright side of death & C a d G$^7$ C a d G$^7$ \\*
\refrenspace Just before you draw your terminal breath & C a d G$^7$ C a d G$^7$ \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Life's a piece of shit \\*
When you look at it & d G \\*
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true & C a \\*
You'll see it's all a show & d G C \\*
Keep 'em laughing as you go & d G \\*
Just remember that the last laugh is on you & C a \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace And always look\ldots \\*
