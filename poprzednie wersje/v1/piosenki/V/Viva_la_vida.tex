\akordy{D E A fis} $\| \times 2$ \\[1.6mm]

I used to rule the world & fis D E \\
Seas would rise when I gave the word & A fis \\
Now in the morning I sleep alone & D E \\
Sweep the streets I used to own & A fis \\[1.6mm]

\akordy{D E A fis} $\| \times 2$ \\[1.6mm]

I used to roll the dice & fis D E \\
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes & A fis \\
Listen as the crowd would sing: & D E \\
,,Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!'' & A fis \\
One minute I held the key & fis D E \\
Next the walls were closed on me & A fis \\
And I discovered that my castles stand & D E \\
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand & A fis \\[1.6mm]

\refrenspace I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing & D E \\
\refrenspace Roman Cavalry choirs are singing & A fis \\
\refrenspace Be my mirror, my sword, and shield & D E \\
\refrenspace My missionaries in a foreign field & A fis \\
\refrenspace For some reason I can't explain & D E \\
\refrenspace Once you go there was never, & A fis \\
\refrenspace never an honest word & D E \\
\refrenspace That was when I ruled the world & cis fis \\[1.6mm]

\akordy{D E A fis} $\| \times 2$ \\[1.6mm]

It was the wicked and wild wind & fis D E \\
Blew down the doors to let me in. & A fis \\
Shattered windows and the sound of drums & D E \\
People couldn't believe what I'd become & A fis \\
Revolutionaries wait & fis D E \\
For my head on a silver plate & A fis \\
Just a puppet on a lonely string & D E \\
Oh who would ever want to be king? & A fis \\[1.6mm]

\refrenspace I hear Jerusalem bells\ldots \\[1.6mm]

But that was when I ruled the world & cis fis \\[1.6mm]
