\begin{piosenka}{Every breath you take -- the Police}
Every breath you take & G \\
And every move you make & e \\
Every bond you break, every step you take & C D \\
I’ll be watching you & e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Every single day & G \\
And every word you say & e \\
Every game you play, every night you stay & C D \\
I’ll be watching you & e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Oh, can’t you see & C \\
You belong to me & G \\
How my poor heart aches & A$^7$ \\ 
With every step you take & D \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Every move you make & G \\
Every vow you break & e \\
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake & C D \\ 
I’ll be watching you & e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Since you’ve gone I’ve been lost without a trace & Es \\
I dream at night I can only see your face & F \\
I look around but it’s you I can’t replace & Es \\
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace & F \\
I keep crying baby, baby please & Es G \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Oh, can’t you see\ldots \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Every move you make\ldots \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Every move you make, every step you take & C D \\
I’ll be watching you & D e \\
I’ll be watching you & D G \\
