{\small \begin{piosenka}{Lemon Tree -- Fool's Garden}
I'm sitting here in the boring room & e h \\*
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon & e h \\*
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do & e h \\*
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you & e h \\*
But nothing ever happens and I wonder & a h e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I'm driving around in my car & e h \\*
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far & e h \\*
I'd like to change my point of view & e h \\*
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you & e h \\*
But nothing ever happens and I wonder & a h e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace I wonder how, I wonder why & G D \\*
\refrenspace Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky & e h \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree & C D G D \\*
\refrenspace I'm turning my head up and down & G D \\*
\refrenspace I'm turning turning turning turning turning around & e h \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see is just another lemon tree & C D G D \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I'm sitting here, I miss the power & e h \\*
I'd like to go out taking a shower & e h \\*
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head & e h \\*
I feel so tired put myself into bed & e h \\*
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder & a h e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Isolation is not good for me & H e \\*
Isolation I don't want to sit on the lemon tree & D G H \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy & e h \\*
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy & e h \\*
And everything will happen and you wonder & a h e \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace I wonder how, I wonder why & G D \\*
\refrenspace Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky & e h \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see is just another lemon tree & C D G D \\*
\refrenspace I'm turning my head up and down & G D \\*
\refrenspace I'm turning turning turning turning turning around & e h \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree & C D G D \\*
\refrenspace I wonder how, I wonder why & G D \\*
\refrenspace Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky & e h \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see & C D \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see & C D \\*
\refrenspace And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree & C D G \\*
