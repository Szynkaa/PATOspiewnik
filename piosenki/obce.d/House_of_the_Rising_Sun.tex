\begin{piosenka}[3mm]{House of the Rising Sun -- Animals}
There is a house in New Orleans & a C D F \\
They call the Rising Sun & a C E \\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy & a C D F \\ 
And God I know I'm one & a E a C D F a E a E \\ [\zwrotkaspace]

My mother was a tailor & a C D F \\
Sewed my new blue jeans & a C E \\
My father was gamblin' man & a C D F \\ 
Down in New Orleans & a E a C D F a E a E \\ [\zwrotkaspace]

Now the only thing a gambler needs & a C D F \\
Is a suitcase and a trunk & a C E \\
And the only time he'll be satisfied & a C D F \\ 
Is when he's all a-drunk & a E a C D F a E a E \\ [\zwrotkaspace]

Oh mother, tell your children & a C D F \\
Not to do what I have done & a C E \\
Spend your lives in sin and misery & a C D F \\ 
In the house of the Rising Sun & a E a C D F a E a E \\ [\zwrotkaspace]

Well I've got one foot on the platform & a C D F \\
The other foot on the train & a C E \\
I'm going back to New Orleans & a C D F \\ 
To wear that ball and chain & a E a C D F a E a E \\ [\zwrotkaspace]

Well there is a house in New Orleans & a C D F \\
They call the Rising Sun & a C E \\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy & a C D F \\ 
And God I know I'm one & a E a C D F a E a E \\
