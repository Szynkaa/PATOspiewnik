\begin{piosenka}{Wake me up -- Avicii}

Feeling my way through the darkness & e C G D \\
Guided by a beating heart \\
I can't tell where the journey will end \\
But I know where to start \\[\zwrotkaspace]

They tell me I'm too young to understand \\
They say I'm caught up in a dream \\
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes \\
Well that's fine by me \\[\zwrotkaspace]
	
\refrenspace So wake me up when it's all over & e C G D \\
\refrenspace When I'm wiser and I'm older \\
\refrenspace All this time I was finding myself \\
\refrenspace And I didn't know I was lost \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I tried carrying the weight of the world \\
But I only have two hands \\
I hope I get the chance to travel the world \\
And I don't have any plans \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I wish that I could stay forever this young \\
Not afraid to close my eyes \\
Life's a game made for everyone \\
And love is a prize \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace So wake me up\ldots $\| \times 2$ \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I didn't know I was lost $\| \times 4$ & h G D A \\[\zwrotkaspace]
