{\small \begin{piosenka}{Hallelujah -- Leonard Cohen/Rufus Wainwright}
I've heard there was a secret chord & G e \\*
That David played, and it pleased the Lord & G e \\*
But you don't really care for music, do you? & C D G D \\*
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth & G C D \\*
The minor fall, the major lift & e C \\*
The baffled king composing Hallelujah & D h e \\[1mm]

\refrenspace Hallelujah, hallelujah & C e \\*
\refrenspace Hallelujah, hallelujah & C G D G D \\[1mm]

Your faith was strong but you needed proof & G e \\*
You saw her bathing on the roof & G e \\*
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you & C D G D \\*
She tied you to a kitchen chair & G C D \\*
She broke your throne, she cut your hair & e C \\*
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah & D h e \\[1mm]

\refrenspace Hallelujah\ldots \\[1mm]

Baby, I've been here before & G e \\*
I know this room, I've walked this floor & G e \\*
I used to live alone before I knew you & C D G D \\*
I've seen your flag on the marble arch & G C D \\*
Love is not a victory march & e C \\*
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah & D h e \\[1mm]

\refrenspace Hallelujah\ldots \\[1mm]

There was a time you let me know & G e \\*
What's really going on below & G e \\*
But now you never show it to me, do you? & C D G D \\*
And remember when I moved in with you & G C D \\*
The holy dove was moving too & e C \\*
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah & D h e \\[1mm]

\refrenspace Hallelujah\ldots \\[1mm]

Maybe there’s a God above & G e \\*
But all I’ve ever learned from love & G e \\*
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you & C D G D \\*
It’s not a cry you can hear at night & G C D \\*
It’s not somebody who's seen the light & e C \\*
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah & D h e \\[1mm]

\refrenspace Hallelujah\ldots \\*
