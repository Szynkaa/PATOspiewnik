His army of elves at his hooves did they revel & G D G E \\[\zwrotkaspace]
 
They came after me with masterful deceit & a D d \\
Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth & G E a \\
While the devil’s horns minced our tender meat & a D d \\
And so cried the Witcher ``He can’t be bleat'' & G G E \\[\zwrotkaspace]
