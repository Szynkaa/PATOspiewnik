\begin{piosenka_dluga}{Shape of you -- Ed Sheeran}

The club isn't the best place to find a lover & h e \\*
So the bar is where I go & G A \\*
Me and my friends at the table doing shots \\*
Drinking fast and then we talk slow \\*
Come over and start up a conversation with just me \\*
And trust me I'll give it a chance now \\*
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox \\*
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like \\[\zwrotkaspace]
	
\refrenspace Girl, you know I want your love & h e \\*
\refrenspace Your love was handmade for somebody like me & G A \\*
\refrenspace Come on now, follow my lead \\*
\refrenspace I may be crazy, don't mind me \\*
\refrenspace Say, boy, let's not talk too much \\*
\refrenspace Grab on my waist and put that body on me  \\*
\refrenspace Come on now, follow my lead \\*
\refrenspace Come, come on now, follow my lead \\*
\refrenspace  I'm in love with the shape of you \\*
\refrenspace We push and pull like a magnet do \\*
\refrenspace Although my heart is falling too \\*
\refrenspace I'm in love with your body \\*
\refrenspace And last night you were in my room \\*
\refrenspace And now my bedsheets smell like you \\*
\refrenspace Every day discovering something brand new \\*
\refrenspace I'm in love with your body \\*
\refrenspace $\|$ Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I \\*
\refrenspace I'm in love with your body $\| \times 3$ \\*
\refrenspace Every day discovering something brand new \\*
\refrenspace I'm in love with the shape of you \\[\zwrotkaspace]

One week in we let the story begin \\*
We're going out on our first date \\*
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat \\*
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate \\*
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour \\*
And how your family is doing okay \\*
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat \\*
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like \\[\zwrotkaspace]

\refrenspace Girl, you know I want your love\ldots \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Come on, be my baby, come on $\| \times 4$ \\[\zwrotkaspace]

I'm in love with the shape of you \\*
We push and pull like a magnet do \\*
Although my heart is falling too \\*
I'm in love with your body \\*
Last night you were in my room \\*
And now my bedsheets smell like you \\*
Every day discovering something brand new \\*
I'm in love with your body \\*
Come on, be my baby, come on $\| \times 4$ \\*
Every day discovering something brand new \\*
I'm in love with the shape of you \\[\zwrotkaspace]
