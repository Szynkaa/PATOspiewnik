Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me & C G d F \\*
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed & C G d F \\*

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead & C G d F \\[\zwrotkaspace]

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming & C G \\*
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running & d F \\*
Didn't make sense not to live for fun & C G \\*

You'll never shine if you don't glow & d F \\[\zwrotkaspace]

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder & C G \\*
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older & d F \\*
But the meteor men beg to differ & C G \\*

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin & C G \\*
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim & d F \\*

And we could all use a little change & C G d F \\[\zwrotkaspace]
